## Project summary

The project is a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) management tool. It allows players to create and manage their characters, and game masters to create and manage their campaigns.  
The project uses artificial intelligence to generate missions, NPCs and locations for the game masters.  
The game masters can then manage the generated content and use it in their campaigns.  

## Setup

You'll need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project following the `.env.example` file.

You can then run the `npm install` command from the root of the project to install the dependencies of all the services in the monorepo.
