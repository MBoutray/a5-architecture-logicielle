# Package: Database

This package uses Prisma to manage the database.

## Setup

By now, you should have installed the dependencies of the project. If not, run `npm install` in the root of the project.

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the `database` package using the `.env.example` file as a template.

## Commands

- `npm run db:generate` : Generates the client based on the schema.
- `npm run db:push` : Pushes the schema to the database.
